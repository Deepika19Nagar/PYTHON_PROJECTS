**---PROJECT-"HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION"--**
     **Its a regression problem.**__
        Price of the property is most important decision criterion when people buy homes.Real Estate firms needs to be consistent in their 
        pricing in order to attract buyers.
         House price prediction is "Machine Learning Model" project in which we are predicting price on the bases of some attributes.  
         In this project, there is the usage of some libraries such as Pandas,Numpy,datapipe_utils,standardscaler,one hot encoder.
         There is also the usage of sklearn linear model(linear_regression,model selection(train test split), ensemble(Random forest,extra tree regressor). 

**--Project="Retail Domain"- The store should be open or not.--**
   **Its a classification problem.**
   This data set is related with retail domain and challenge is to predict whether a store should get opened or not based on certain factors such as sales, population, area 
   etc.This is the "Machine Learning Model" project.
         In this project, there is the usage of some libraries such as Pandas,Numpy,datapipe_utils,standardscaler,one hot encoder.
         There is also the usage of sklearn linear model(logistic_regression,model selection(train test split), ensemble(Random forest classifier,decsion tree classifier).
